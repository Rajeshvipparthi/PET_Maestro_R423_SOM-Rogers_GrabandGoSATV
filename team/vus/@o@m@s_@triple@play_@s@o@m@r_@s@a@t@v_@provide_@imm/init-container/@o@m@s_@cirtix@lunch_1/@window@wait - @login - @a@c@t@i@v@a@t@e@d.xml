    <description>This Action waits for an event (CREATED, ACTIVATED, DESTROYED) for a window with a title (that can be a regexp) and optionally in a certain region of the screen.

Possible parameters are:&#xd;
- windowName (required): Window name, that can be a regular expression. It can contain a NeoLoad variable. If a regular expression is used, then any characters considered as reserved need to be escaped according to the regex syntax standard (for example characters \|?*+()[].). For example, "Document.*" will match any window name starting with string "Document", and "Document \(\d+\)" will match any window name with "Document" followed by a number in parenthesis, such as "Document (1)" or "Document (10)". &#xd;
- windowEvent (required): Event to wait: CREATED, ACTIVATED, DESTROYED. Default value is "ACTIVATED".&#xd;
- windowRect (optional): Region of the window in the format: [poxX,poxY,width,height].&#xd;
- waitTimeoutInMs (required): Maximum timeout in milliseconds to wait for receiving the right windowEvent, if 0 it will wait infinitely. Default value is "60000".</description>
